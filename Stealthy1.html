        Halo <span>Frontlines</span>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Your team waits until the dead of night before they start thier assault.<br>
        The Covenant have hidden out in an old train station for the night<br>
        but they have lookouts posted all over the place. Your team is<br>
        situated across a few rooftops armed with sniper rifles that have night-<br>
        vision scopes. You give the signal to open fire and immediately your<br>
        team fire a volley of shots towards the enemy. The Covenant are startled<br>
        but are quick to fire back with their own barrage of shots. Many of the<br>
        Covenant are being picked off but with your team being outnumbered by a<br>
        factor of nearly 1:15 it doesn't seem like you are making much of a dent.<br>
        Your team continues to take out enemies one by one but as your position has<br>
        been compromised it is only a matter of time before your team is overwhelmed.<br>
        Your team must decide whether they should attemt to retreat while they still<br>
        can or whether to hold out and attempt to push the enemy back.<br><br>
        Pick one of the options below
