        Halo <span>Frontlines</span>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Half of your team moves forward in the warthogs while the other<br>
        half hang back in the scorpion. As the warthogs move up they realise<br>
        there are significantly more Covenant than they had been told. With<br>
        this information your team is able to radio up the tank to move to a<br>
        position where they can try and take out the bigger enemies first as<br>
        they will cause the most threat for their vehicles. When the scorpion<br>
        gets into position your team begins raining shots at the Covenant. Some<br>
        well placed scorpion shots take out a couple of the heavy grunts which<br>
        allows your team to push up further. As your team moves up a group<br>
        ambushes one of your warthogs and ends up taking them out. You are now<br>
        faced with the decison on whether to continue your attack with only 9<br>
        marines or whether to attempt to retreat.<br><br>
        Pick one of the options below
