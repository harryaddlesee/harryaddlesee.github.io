        Halo <span>Frontlines</span>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Your team moves up and begins picking off the enemies at the back<br>
        of the pack which causes the entire Covenant group to quickly turn<br>
        around and begin opening fire towards your team. You quickly take<br>
        cover while continuing to send down supressing fire to stop the Covenant<br>
        from rushing you. Your team is managing to mow down the swarms of enemies<br>
        that are trying to push you back but they outnumber your team by a factor<br>
        of nearly 1:12 so there are still many more to come. Some of the higher<br>
        ranking Covenant, who take much more of a beating, begin to push you.<br>
        Your team won't manage to hold thier position for much longer so they<br>
        need to make the decision of either attempting to retreat from the<br>
        fight or whether to make an attempt to suprise the enemy by rushing<br>
        them.<br><br>
        Pick one of the options below
